Turn your EconomyAPI money into items to trade them!
**Right-Click** to deposit a note and type **/note {amount}** to get a note.
You can change the lore/name/ID of the banknotes in v1.1.0 and up and you can change all the messages in V1.2.0 and up.

You will need EconomyAPI for this to work!

This is just a simple, but fun plugin.

All notes from v1.0.0 won't be recognized in v1.1.0 or later!
